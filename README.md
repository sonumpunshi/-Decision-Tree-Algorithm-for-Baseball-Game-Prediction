# -Decision-Tree-Algorithm-for-Baseball-Game-Prediction

Developed a decision tree classifier to predict the winner of a baseball game based on a dataset of 70,000 games, considering various attributes like winning percentage, weather, temperature, injuries, starting pitchers, days since last game, and run differential.

Implemented the decision tree algorithm using information gain to split the nodes and dealt with missing values denoted by "?" in the dataset.

The output included a visual representation of the constructed decision tree, the accuracy of the classifier based on the validation data, and a new file containing the test set with predicted values.
